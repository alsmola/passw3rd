=== 0.2.1 / 2011-11-8

Added option to fail silently.  Pretty common need in a Rails environment.

=== 0.2.0 / 2011-11-5

Added acceptance tests as a contract for future features.  
Collapsed the KeyLoader class, eliminated the KeyPair class.  If for some reason you referenced those classes, things will break.  But you wouldn't do that, would you?
More testing goodness.

=== 0.1.3 / 2011-11-4

From key rotation, arose cipher changing

[passw3rd (gh-17-change_cipher *$)]$ rake change_cipher[~/passwords,~/passwords,aes-128-cbc,aes-256-cbc]
[passw3rd (gh-17-change_cipher *$)]$ rake change_cipher[~/passwords,~/passwords,aes-256-cbc,aes-256-cfb]

=== 0.1.2 / 2011-11-4

Added key rotation script
[passw3rd (gh-10-key_rotation *$)]$ rake rotate_keys[~/passwords,~/passwords,aes-256-cbc]

=== 0.1.0 / 2011-10-31

Finally some real life support
* Defaults to aes-256 for regulatory compliance (Thanks Edward Bonver)
* loads URIs, so password files can live anywhere (Thanks Ben Duong)
* Internals: code cleanup (Thanks @xternal), guard + test::unit + rspec love, better configuration options (thanks again @xternal)

=== 0.0.11 / 2011-10-12

Keys/ivs were being written as arrays, broke openssl command line compatibility:
$ openssl enc -e -aes-256-cbc -K `cat ~/.passw3rd-encryptionKey`  -iv `cat ~/.passw3rd-encryptionIV` -in README.md -out test.out
$ openssl enc -d -aes-256-cbc -K `cat ~/.passw3rd-encryptionKey`  -iv `cat ~/.passw3rd-encryptionIV` -out README.md -in test.out

=== 0.0.8 / 2011-10-02

Custom key directories

=== 0.0.6 / 2011-10-02

Added custom password directories, more tests.  Some code cleanup.  Java version maven site generation.

=== 0.0.1 / 2010-06-07

* 1 major enhancement

  * Adding ruby gem packaging
